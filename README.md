# DeploymentWorkshop

In this repository we will be learning how to deploy a logistic regression model on the famous iris dataset using Streamlit - a powerful Python library for building web applications

The model is deployed at https://baoshinyeo-deploymentworkshop-app-6glh6c.streamlit.app/

### For Streamlit Development and Deployment

1. Install git and clone the repo `sudo yum install git` and `git clone <url>`
2. Go into directory using `cd DeploymentWorkshop`
3. Install dependencies `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
   -- You can try running Streamlit with `streamlit hello` to test if Streamlit is working properly on your local machine
4. Start the service `streamlit run app.py`
